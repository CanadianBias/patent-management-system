# Patent Management System
*CS 490 Senior Project*

Currently, IP and patent management systems for inventors mostly are customer relationship
management systems that both lack simplicity and useability in design and lack a mechanism for alerting
patent applicants about expiration dates. Often, if submission or renewal dates are missed, the patent
application could be lost or not filed. 

The project aims to provide inventors a place to store and manage
their patent application information and potentially notify patent applicants of upcoming dates through
text and/or email.
