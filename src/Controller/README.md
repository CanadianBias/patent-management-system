> [!NOTE]
> The below controllers lack logic, they're currently placeholders
- AboutController
- LogoutController
    - I may have accidentally misunderstood the pathing for Symfony when it comes to logging in and out, and I don't want to change it in case I messed something up
- ViewCalendarController

Be aware that the ViewLanguages controller is used to test queries and database data.
